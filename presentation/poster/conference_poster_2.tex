%	INTRODUCTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            
\begin{block}{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item This project is about to implement an autonomous car that uses software-defined network (SDN) to communicate between the different nodes in the car. SDN is a new type of technology that moves the control part in the switches to a controller. The communication over the network will be done via something called VSOME/IP and is an application middleware designed for the car industry and compatible with AUTOSAR. On the cat is also different types of sensors used to monitor the car performance and its surrounding. There all the sensors will communicate to each other via the SDN network. 
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
%
%\begin{block}{Requerments}
%    This is the design requirement for the ESS-CAR
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item Design and evaluate the software- and system-architecture %for the model car platform. The
%        architecture shall integrate (and potentially adapt) already %existing functionality to achieve a robust and
%        predictable system design.
%
%        \item Setup the physical platform to use different sensors and %actuators (ultrasonic sensor, IR sensor,
%        accelerometer, servo, motor, etc.). The peripherals shall be %controlled with dedicated microcontrollers
%        (Arduino). SPI bus is used to communicate between Arduinos and %Beagle Bone ECUs. Software on the
%        Beagle Bone ECUs shall provide the respective services to t
%        he system using SOME/IP.
%
%        \item Setup the camera module for the Raspberry Pi ECU. This %requires the physical setup (mounting the
%        camera and designing the hardware to do so) but also a software %service that will make the camera
%        data (e.g. traffic sign detection through AI algorithm) %available to other software components over
%        the SOME/IP middleware. This software service shall be %configurable to switch between different
%        quality modes that will affect the produced network load.
%        4) Setup a display that will be mounted on the car. The display %service shall be located on a different
%        ECU than the camera node. The basic functionality is the display %of the video stream that is provided
%        by the camera.
%
%        \item Identify some typical fault models, design and implement %the fault injectors that inject the faults
%        on the network nodes and switches.
%
%        \item Monitor traffic on the ECUs to detect fault conditions and %trigger reconfiguration.
%        \item Develop coordinated boot and shutdown sequences to %efficiently use the model car.
%        \item Write a project report documenting the details of %functional blocks and services, as well as basic
%        system evaluation results.
%
%
%
%        
%    \end{itemize}
%
%    For the ESS-NW is the following the requirements
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item Build the model car(s) with Turnigy SCT 2WD 1/10 Brushless %Short Course Truck
%        (KIT) upgraded version.
%
%        \item Set up the physical embedded system platform consisting of %BeagelBoneBlack
%        nodes and Zodiac FX SDN-Switches, plus one Raspberry Pi as
%        SDN-Controller and Arduino To interface with sensors and %actuators.
%
%        \item Investigate available implementations of SDN-Controller %and select one that best
%        meets the project requirements.
%
%        \item Design and implement a basic SDN-Controller application on %one of the ECUs.
%        
%        \item Extend the SDN-Controller to manually assign network flows %to preconfigured
%        routes with defined monitoring points on the switches.
%
%        \item Extend the SDN-Controller in a way that the network %resources are reassigned
%        during runtime if message behaviour changes. This requires %monitoring of
%        messages on the switches and reconfiguration of the network at %runtime.
%
%        \item Write a project report documenting the details of %functional blocks and services, as
%        well as basic system evaluation results.
%    \end{itemize}
%

%	NETWORK
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{block}{Network}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Software defined network (SDN) is a type of network configuration that moves the intelligent from the switches to a controller unit. This is to make the network smart and can sort packages depending on their priorities and traffic load to different paths, to enable faster computing and distribute the network load. It also self-configured to if a link is down or a new link is up it will detect it.  SDN is done via a protocol called OpenFlow to control the switches. 
        
        \item For this project is only three SDN switches of type Zodiac FX used and the network is configured according to the topology in figure \ref{pic:network}. The controller is a raspberry pi model 3 that uses the RYU SDN framework to control the switches and to gather information. 
        
        \item To send information between the nodes is a middleware application called VSOME/IP and is an application designed for automotive products e.g. cares and is compatible with AUTOSAR. 
        
        \item At the edges of the network is Arduino used to control the sensors, and to gather the information. This information is then passed via an SPI interface to a Beaglebone black that sends it out on the network.  
    \end{itemize}

%	Control and Sensors 
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{block}{Control and sensors}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item On the car is three ultrasound sensors placed to detect object in front of the car, to give information to the controller if something is in front of it. Three sensors was used to detect obstacle from left, right and in the middle of the car direction
        
        \item The car should be able to detect traffic signs, and we did a simplification of only using colours to drive the car. If there is a green signed in front of the car will it follow it and if the sign is red it will stop.  
        
        \item To measure the speed of the car, is a IR sensor placed close to the weal and on the weal in aluminium tape to reflect the light. With some calibration can we get the speed. 
    \end{itemize}
    
    \end{block}



    \begin{block}{Assembley}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item The car was assembled via some acyle plastic that was used to cut out the pieces to assemble the devices one the car, as shown in figure \ref{fig:car1}.
            \item The design of the assembly platform is done in Autodesk fusion 360.
            
            
            \item The car is power via a lithium battery of 3 cells and is used power the engine and all the components of the car. The power is deliver from the PCB designs and via a boost converter to boost the 5v to 9v to run one of the switches.
