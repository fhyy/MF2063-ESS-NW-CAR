abstract = {Abstract With the advent of cloud computing, many new networking concepts have been introduced to simplify network management and bring innovation through network programmability. The emergence of the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm is one of these adopted concepts in the cloud model so as to eliminate the network infrastructure maintenance processes and guarantee easy management. In this fashion, SDN offers real-time performance and responds to high availability requirements. However, this new emerging paradigm has been facing many technological hurdles; some of them are inherent, while others are inherited from existing adopted technologies. In this paper, our purpose is to shed light on SDN related issues and give insight into the challenges facing the future of this revolutionary network model, from both protocol and architecture perspectives. Additionally, we aim to present different existing solutions and mitigation techniques that address SDN scalability, elasticity, dependability, reliability, high availability, resiliency, security, and performance concerns.

abstract = {Road fatalities are decreasing every year. A major reason is the increased presence and the increased complexity of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). ADAS are becoming one of the biggest research areas in the automotive industry. This thesis presents a design and implementation of an automotive experimental platform for ADAS.The thesis provides an overview of automotive concepts related to ADAS, such as Electronic Control Unit (ECU), commonly used communication protocols in cars and Operating Systems (OS) used for automotive purposes. In addition a general background to ADAS is presented as well as an introduction to the state of the art technology.The design of the platform is presented with a detailed hardware description as well as a thorough motivation to the design choices. The design consists of multiple ECUs connected through a switched Ethernet network with multiple switches. The design also includes a model car equipped with actuators and sensors, made to mimic a real car.Several functions have been implemented in the system such as reading sensor data, controlling actuators and a control interface to control the car. As a proofof-concept platform the resulting system can be exploited and flexibly extended for various ADAS functions and safety engineering.},
