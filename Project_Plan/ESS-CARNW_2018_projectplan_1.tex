\section*{Background}
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is one of the hottest research
areas in the automotive industry. ADAS should be capable of sensing the
vehicle's surroundings, as well as vehicle's own status. To achieve those
abilities, multiple sensors and Embedded Control Units (ECUs) are used
in the ADAS and a network inside the vehicle is established to combine
the data gathered from different nodes.

The two projects ''ESS-Car Embedded Services for a Self-Adaptive Car'' and
''ESS-Network Embedded services for Self-Adaptive Networking'' were
provided by professor De-Jiu Chen at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
The idea of our projects are from Viktor Karlquist's Master's thesis
\cite{viktor}. He presented a design and implementation of an automotive
experimental platform for ADAS, and the ''ESS-Car'' team from last year's
MF2063 course round has already built a autonomous vehicle prototype based
on the thesis \cite{old_ess}. Our projects will be focused on the
development and extension of the prototype. Instead of traditional IP
networks, software defined networking, which centralizes the control
plane in the network and allows for a better granular and agile network
management, will be implemented by ''ESS-NW'' team. ''ESS-Car'' team will
implement error injectors on the new prototype which makes the car more
autonomous.

\begin{itemize}

    \item ESS-CAR and ESS-NW entries in the MF2063 project catalog

\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
The goals of the project can be divided into two parts, goals concerning
the network implementation on the car and goals concerning the remaining
software and hardware system architecture of the car. As both parts are
heavily tied into each other some of the sub-goals are dependent on
sub-goals from the opposing . The overarching goal of the network
implementation is of a more exploratory nature as it is a problem that has
not been studied clearly, thus the project aims to explore what different
network implementations can be beneficial in this type of infrastructure.
The overarching goal can be stated as ''The goal of the project is to
reconfigure the network using SDN-switches and a Raspberry Pi as a SDN
controller''. The overarching goal for the software and hardware system
architecture can be stated as ''The goal of the project is to increase the
robustness by revising the existing architecture and implementing
additional features such as vision control and a display service.''  Not
related to the technical aspects of the car, but rather the ambitions of
the project members, are also the business goals of the project.

\subsection{Technical Goals}
The technical subgoals are divided up into two parts. Subgoals concerning
the ethernet network which takes care of all of the communication between
different parts of the system. Subgoals concerning the hardware and system
architecture which implements all of the functionalities of the system
except for the network communication.

\subsubsection{Hardware and Software System Architecture}
As discussed in the background, the project builds on an existing
architecture. Thus most goals consists of improving the existing
architecture or examining alternative implementations. The first subgoal
consists of making the system more robust by extending the hardware
architecture. This should be done such that there is one unique
microprocessor for each sensor and actuator in the system while maintaining
the existing functionalities of the car. The next subgoal is to monitor the
operations of the ECUâ€™s such that the car can be made fail-safe by
implementing fault-detection, watchdogs and battery level indication.
The next subgoal is to develop a formal boot- and shutdown-sequence such
the the car becomes reliable and fail-safe under normal operation. The
final subgoal is to extend the functionality of the existing system by
setting up a camera module and choosing an AI algorithm to detect some
external stimuli such as a traffic sign such that the rest of the system
can react to it (choosing the appropriate speed or steering for example). 

\subsection{Business Goals}
The first subgoal is to assemble the car and set up the physical layer,
which includes the SDN-switches and the SDN-controller. This is a
dependency the other goals. 

\section{Organization}
The requirements of the project were divided into a number of topics,
with each team member being focused on two topics. Additionally, Leon and
Fredrik have been appointed roles of Project Manager and Secretary,
respectively.
